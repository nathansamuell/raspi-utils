# raspi-utils
My personal set of raspberry pi utilities for troubleshooting and fixing

start by using sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade!

benchmark -- outputs to a CSV file, used to benchmark system performance

installessentials -- the barebone software that i install on every pi i work with

installdocker -- some projects or use cases require a docker image -- i added this outside of the essentials script for debugging purposes and to avoid unnecessary system footprint if not needed
